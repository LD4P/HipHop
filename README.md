# HipHop
Here you will find files (target ontology files, SHACL for application profiles, etc.) in support of cataloging of Cornell Hip Hop Collections using linked data within the context of the LD4P project. 

This repository builds off https://github.com/ld4l-labs/bibliotek-o, https://github.com/LD4P/PerformedMusicOntology, and possibly other work yet to be identified.
